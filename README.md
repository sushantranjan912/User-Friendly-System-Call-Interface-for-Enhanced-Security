## 🔎 Project Overview

Secure System Call Interface (Enhanced Security File Manager) is a web-based platform designed to **perform system-level operations safely** (like file management and process execution) via a controlled interface — with **authentication, role-based authorization, encryption, and comprehensive logging**.  
It acts as a “gateway” for system calls, ensuring unauthorized or malicious operations are prevented, and all activity is auditable.

**Why this project matters:**

- Most native system calls expose powerful operations — misuse could compromise the system.  
- This interface restricts those operations to authorized users only.  
- Detailed logs + audit trails + optional analytics help administrators monitor usage and detect suspicious behavior.

## 🚀 Demo / Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sushantranjan912/User-Friendly-System-Call-Interface-for-Enhanced-Security.git
cd User-Friendly-System-Call-Interface-for-Enhanced-Security

# 2. Setup virtual environment (for backend)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Run the backend
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload

# 5. Open frontend in browser
# (Open index.html or as per frontend docs; or start frontend server if configured)
```

| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authentication & Auth Layer**      | Secure login, token-based sessions, role-based access control (RBAC)                                                            |
| **Protected System Call Interface**  | Safe wrappers for file operations, process/network calls; input sanitization; permission enforcement                            |
| **File Manager + Encryption**        | Upload / Download / Edit / Delete / Recycle-Bin for files, AES-256 encryption support, optional file passcode locking           |
| **Audit Logging**                    | Detailed logging of every action — user, timestamp, operation, parameters, status, IP/client info                               |
| **Security Dashboard / Admin Panel** | Stats & metrics: total files, encrypted files, active users, unauthorized attempts; real-time logs; system-call activity charts |
| **Future-ready hooks**               | Designed for optional modules like anomaly detection, MFA, firewall / rate-limiting, version history, alerts                    |


💡 Key Features

🔐 Secure Authentication — login with tokens, role-based permission; separation between admin and normal users.

🗄️ Advanced File Management — upload, edit, download, delete; encrypted storage; file-level locking and recycle bin with restore.

⚙️ Controlled System Calls — OS-level operations executed only through validated, sanitized requests.

📜 Full Audit Logs — every system call and user action logged with details (user, time, parameters, result).

📊 Admin Dashboard — view system activity, file stats, unauthorized attempts, real-time logs, and activity graphs.

🧭 Installation & Usage

Clone & setup

git clone https://github.com/sushantranjan912/User-Friendly-System-Call-Interface-for-Enhanced-Security.git
cd User-Friendly-System-Call-Interface-for-Enhanced-Security
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


Configure settings

(Optional) Update configuration — e.g., encryption keys, database path, role permissions, etc.

Run the backend API

cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload


Launch frontend

Either open frontend/index.html in browser or start frontend development server (if configured).

Admin or user login, then perform permitted operations (file upload / download / view logs) as per your role.

Admin Dashboard

Use admin credentials to view dashboard: system logs, file stats, unauthorized attempts, activity graphs, etc.
